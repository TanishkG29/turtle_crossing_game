Reach out to the opposite end of the road dodging the increasing speed and number of the vehicles passing with increasing level of toughness. 

In this game, suppose you are standing at an end of a busy and heavy-traffic road and want to cross beating the ever increasing speed of the vehicles. 
And, you only have to have two options: either go forward that too with only a fixed step .
HOW WILL YOU ACHIEVE A SCORE THAT IS ITSELF A CHALLENGE AMONG THE VIEWERS....Explore and have Fun..

Here only LOGIC , "TURTLE" and "Time" modules of python have been put to use to make a simple yet interesting game that 
would urge yourself to try once more !!
